 *    const PropsComponent = withTheme(({ theme }) => ({ fill: theme.colors.primary }), 'PropsComponent');
 * ```
 * These componnents can have their styles/props overriden by including the following overrides:
 * ```{
 *   overides: {
 *     StyledComponent: {
 *       margin: 5,
 *       padding: 15,
 *     },
 *     // #protip: you even have access ðŸ‘‡to component props! This applies to style overrides too ðŸ’¥
 *     PropsComponent: () => ({ theme, isActive }) => ({
