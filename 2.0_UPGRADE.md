# 2.0 Upgrade

## Introduction

The Apollos 2.0 Upgrade is a big one. In order to say ahead of React Native developments, and to continue to introduce and improve existing features, we had to go forward with updating the versions of some of the most important packages in our app. Updating to this release will be a bit of a chore, but once you have completed the migration you'll have access to a number of new features Including...

- Apollo Client 3.0
  - Better API
  - Integrated hooks support
  - Less dependencies
  - Better under the hood state/tree representation
- React Navigation 5.0
  - Improved API (pretty much 100% component based)
  - Improved Support for Native Screens / Navigation
- React Native 63
  - Live Reloading (it works this time, seriously!)
  - A bunch of other stuff

and in our app

- Media Player
  - Completely redesigned media player.
  - More capable of taking advantage of platform features.
- ContentSingle
  - Now 100% driven by API

## FAQ

### Getting an error about swift files when building in Xcode?

You probally need to make sure you have your swift bridging headers setup properly, even if you already have Swift files listed in your Xcode sidebar. In Xcode, add a new file to your project, selecting "Swift" as the type. Accept any prompts asking you if you wish to create a bridging header.
