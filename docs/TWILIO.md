# Twilio Setup

This will explain how to get Twilio set up on your API. It's very simple. Create a new Twilio account if you don't already have one and then supply these variables to your local and remote server environment variables.

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<account SID>
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<API token>
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=<number in the form: +15555555555>
```
