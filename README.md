# Apollos Template Project

## Getting Started

Click the "Use the Template" button on the repo page â¬†

![template button](https://files-2aze9g2bq.vercel.app)

We are assuming you're using a Mac for this guide. Install tools necessary.

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io)

Clone down your new repo, and run the setup script to set up environments

```
yarn
yarn setup
```

### API

#### Development

If you want to test that your API is functional fill out the `ROCK_API` and `ROCK_TOKEN` in your `.env` file. `ROCK_API` is the URL of your Rock instance with `/api` appended to the end. `ROCK_TOKEN` is the REST key of an admin user. You can get this from "Admin Tools" > "Apollos Dashboard" after you've installed the Apollos Plugin.

Now simply start the server

```
yarn start
```

#### Deploy

We use Heroku by default because it's free and easy to get started. If you'd like to use another platform to host your API, you can skip this section.

[Install the Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up)

```
brew install heroku/brew/heroku
heroku login
```

Create your app on Heroku

```
heroku create APP_NAME [-t OPTIONAL_TEAM]
```

Add your config variables to the remote application

```
heroku config:set ROCK_API=<url> ROCK_TOKEN=<token>
```

We deploy through the Github workflow. You need to set three new [Github secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) in your new repository:

- `HEROKU_API_KEY`: This comes from your Heroku account dashboard and is used to upload
- `HEROKU_APP_NAME`: This is the Heroku app name from above when you created the server
- `APP_DATA_URL`: The URL of your server. You can get this by running `heroku info` and using "Web URL"

![github secret](https://files-5eu5fyz6u.vercel.app)

Simply commit to `master` and push or re-run the action if you haven't made any changes yet. Once the API Deploy action is finished, you should be able to open up the app in the browser

```
heroku open
```

To get started with different API integrations, check out our [docs](https://apollosapp.io)!

### Mobile App

This will outline the steps required to get your Android and iOS apps up and running. You will need a functioning production API from the previous section before moving forward.

Rename your app, this should be the name you want displayed on the phone screen

```
cd apolloschurchapp
npx react-native-rename "<church name>"
```

Add new icons and splash screen. For customization, see [react-native-make](#)

```
yarn icons icon.png
yarn splash icon.png
```

#### Development

Install dependencies and start the server and bundler

```
cd ..
yarn
yarn start
```

Couple final steps you'll need to get the app booted in development mode.

##### iOS

For iOS, you will need to choose a new app identifier and clear out certificates to boot in Development mode. Set the app identifier in the Apple Developer dashboard

[PIC]

Use Xcode to edit the settings:

Now run the command to start the simulator in a separate tab:

```
yarn ios
```

##### Android

Android uses Google Maps for its map service so you will need to register a [Google Maps API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key). Once you have that, define it in your `.env` file:

```
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<KEY>
```

Then start the app on the default installed emulator in a separate tab.

```
yarn android
```

#### Deploy

We use [Fastlane](#) through Github Actions to manage certificates and build uploads. This will walk you through everything you need to get set up with automated deployments.

##### iOS

First thing we'll do is configure the certificates. Change the following values in the `Matchfile`:

`git_url`: This is the _private_ repo you are going to store the certificates
`app_identifier`: The App ID you chose for your app in the Apple Developer Dashboard
`username`: Admin level Apple Developer account, used to manage certificates and profiles

Inside the app directory run `match` to configure the certificates

```
bundle exec faslane ios certificates
```

Next, the `Fastfile`, change all instances of `apolloshchurchapp` and `apolloschurchappprod` to your projects condensed name. It's probably Whatever name you defined earlier with no spaces. You can be sure from `ios/<name>.xcodeproj`

Lastly, in the `Appfile` change, the following variables:

- `app_identifier` - same ID you specified in the `Matchfile`
- `apple_id` - The Apple ID you want responsible for uploads, must be at least "App Manager" level
- `itc_team_id` - iTunes Connect Team ID
- `team_id` - [Apple Developer Portal Team ID](https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership)
