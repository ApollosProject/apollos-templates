# Apollo Engine Setup

This will explain how to get Apollo Engine schema reporting and metrics set up on your API. Go to [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com) and create a new graph. Add the keys they give you to your local and remote environment variables.

```
APOLLO_KEY=<apollo graph key>
APOLLO_SCHEMA_REPORTING=true
```
