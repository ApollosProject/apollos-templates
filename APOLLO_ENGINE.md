# Apollo Engine Setup

This will explain how to get Apollo Engine schema reporting and metrics set up on your API. Go to [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com) and create a new graph. Add the key they give you to your local and remote environment variables.

```
ENGINE_API_KEY=<apollo graph key>
```
